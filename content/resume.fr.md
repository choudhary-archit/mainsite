    {{< resume-section title="Languages" >}}
        {{% resume-entry what="English" %}}
English is and has always been my language of instruction, and accordingly it is the language that most facilitates my critical thinking. Can understand and communicate fluently with almost any English speaker in the world: be it in the UK, Europe, or any part of the US. I am very familiar with most of the accents found in these regions.

I have been learning French since August 2021, when I came to Brussels. I have far exceeded the IB Ab Initio curriculum and am easily a B2 speaker as evidenced by my ability to converse fluently _avec mes potes belges_.

        {{% resume-entry what="Hindi" %}}
Hindi is the first language I have learnt, and the one I still speak at home with my family. I can communicate with any Hindi-speaker in India with precision and fluency over any topic.
