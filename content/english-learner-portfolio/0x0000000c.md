This is in response to "Making Connections".  I would focus on the following
global issue: the dissatisfaction caused by work in the 21st century.  I would
choose the following (exactly) 40 lines from Smith's _Hotel World_, and the
photo below it by McCurry.

> __Why go there?__
> 
> Who needs an excuse? These relaxed, informal, usually small hotels in the
> very hip and trendy Global category are their own raison d'Ãªtre. Affordably
> priced, elegantly adapted, they're miles ahead of the guest-house competition
> when it comes to leaving nothing to be desired.
> 
> __Why stay there?__
> 
> Because you won't be able to help it! New York, Brussels, Leeds, wherever, we
> practically guarantee you that if you're in a Global the temptation will be
> to spend your whole holiday (like we did) in your room, revelling in the
> lush, plush settings they do so well. You'll be so perfectly at home in
> whatever armchair you've happened to fall into that you'll find it hard to

I would argue the following.  The Smith extract embodies the rhetoric employed
by hotels in the 21st century to make people dissatisfied from their work life
stay there.  The McCurry photograph illustrates how dissatisfaction from work
is impossible when one does what they love doing.

The way I approach these kinds of analyses is by making a mindmap on paper; I
enclose the "elements" of the piece in circular boxes and their "effects" in
rectangular boxes, drawing arrows to depict causal relations.  For the Hotel
World extract, the elements that immediately jump out at me (in relation to my
GI) are the following, though there are most definitely others.  I would find
the effect each of these has in relation to my GI.

* The names "World Perfect" and "Global Hotels" themselves.
* The phrase "blissing out"; I've never seen "bliss" be used as a verb outside
  of this chapter. Reminds me of Panav and Natasha's use of "finesse" as a
  verb.
* Expressions like "You won't be able to help it!" and "Why not let yourself
  get utterly oblivious?", although intending to make the reader relax,
  connotate a state of sheer indolence due to the assertive tone; I really
  don't like this.
* Four of the sections have to do with letting yourself go; only one of them
  talks about work (City life). If this section was deleted, these hotels would
  be represented as being literally anti-work.
* The entire "Why stay there?" section is about never leaving your room (I just
  noticed, this sounds like Lise). I _really_ don't like the way it is written.
  It tries very hard to sell this idea of unconditional indolence.

As for the photograph, I have already analysed it earlier in the LP in the
context of a very similar thesis; I would try to adapt that, maybe add to it a
little.
