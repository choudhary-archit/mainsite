On the suggestion of Ms. Tamara, I made a [quotation bank](quotebank.html) for
the texts in my IB English course.  Although I was only supposed to collect
quotes, it seems I ended up extracting complete paragraphs.  Oh well.  I also
uploaded the entirity of Petscop onto this server, for preservation purposes.
It can be accessed [here](/petscop).

The environment a person is living in is reflected very much in the words they
use.  I am going to write another entry soon which will explore the word
choices that Smith makes and what they reveal about the characters and their
living environments.
