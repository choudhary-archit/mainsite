I received Ali Smith's _Hotel World_ this evening from Amazon, and wooo-

hooooo I can safely assert that I have never come across anything like it
before.  The very theme of "past", and the radically spectacular way in which
it was articulated by Ali Smith, is probing beyond any prior expectation.
Before giving a critical account of the text, however, I think I ought properly
to digest it first.  This is going to be __very__ interesting.
