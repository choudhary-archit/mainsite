I have been playing around with the idea of poetry lately.  Why written
literature is a disjoint union of poetry and prose is quite clear to me now.
The predominant purpose of language is to act as an intermediary between two
persons that allows the transfer of thoughts from the first person to the
second one, in as lossless a quality as possible, and every human thought
stimulates either our faculty of reason or our faculty of emotion.  With
literature, we are able to use language to somehow magically store all our
thoughts on an item that can be preserved for centuries.  Of this literature,
prose reigns the texts for whom the thoughts and ideas which are present appeal
to the reader's faculty of reason; and poetry seems to be just the same, except
with the faculty of reason interchanged with the faculty of emotion.

It would thus make complete sense now if I were to say, "Well reasoned study of
a poem can never make you appreciate it, nor can it help you in writing in your
own poems; just as a pathetic study of some text written in prose is useless."
As far as appreciating poetry goes, I believe it comprises in the reader
deciding how well his or her own life is reflected by the poem in
consideration.  With this criterion, you are only able to appreciate poems
insofar as you are aware of your own life, and a visible disinterest in poetry
may be judged as an equal disinterest in oneself.
