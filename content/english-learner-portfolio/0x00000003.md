Ms. Tamara told us to research Ali Smith before our next class, and I'm glad I
did.  Apparently she is a _lesbian_ (assuming Sarah Wood is a female name), and
has held several part-time jobs in her youth, including that of a _waitress_
and a _receptionist_.  Ring any bells?

She also told us to read the epigrams before the first chapter and look up the
people to whom they are attributed, namely

* [Muriel Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Spark)
* [William Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake)
* [Edwin Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Muir)
* [Charles Jencks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Jencks)
* [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus)
