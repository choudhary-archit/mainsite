I am an IB student living on the outskirts of Brussels, interested in
mathematics, literature and philosophy, music, and working out. My opinion on
the last of these is very critical as I only care about getting stronger. I
plan to study mathematics after graduating IB next year.

I have a long history with mathematics. I won the Indian National Mathematical
Olympiad in 2020 and was a merit awardee in 2021, though in my first attempt
in 2019 I got a grand score of 2/102 in PRMO. Beside mathematics, I have been
studying many other subjects at my [school](https://www.isbedu.be), most of whom 
I am very enthusiastic about; especially English. In general, I adore reading,
thinking, and writing, perhaps all three equally so. With music too I have a
certain history, though it is not interesting enough to talk about here.

I exist on the Internet. If you wish to contact me online or just check out
what awesome stuff I have (not) been doing online, see my
[contact page]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}). My résumé is available for potential
employers (or others of the same species) [here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}).
But the most exciting thing on this website is, of course, my [blog]({{< ref
"blog/_index.md" >}}). Scroll down to see the latest posts :)
