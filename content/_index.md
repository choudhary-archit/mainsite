I am a mathematician turned philosopher, who is also a beautiful singer.  You
can check my [résumé]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) if seek thou my unique skills.
If you like to learn, check out my [blog]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}) because
I like to teach.

Here is a random paragraph. After having been wrongfully convicted of treason
in the Netherlands and being handed a life sentence, I managed to escape with
the help of my dear wife Maria. She brought a chest of books to the prison
where I was incarcerated (nothing out of the ordinary since I am an avid
reader) which was then transported back out of the prison, with the the books
replaced by yours truly!

I exist on the Internet. If you wish to contact me through the Internet, go to
my [contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) page.
