Hello! I am an eighteen year old Indian living in Belgium, just finished with the
[IB Diploma Programme](https://www.isbedu.be/). I am interested in most things life
has to offer, from STEM and the humanities to atonal jazz and calisthenics. I
will be in the 2026 class of Engineering Technology at [KU
Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/).  I used to live in
Brussels, where I learnt to speak French. Mainly, however, I speak English and
Hindi --- I spent the first sixteen years of my life in Mumbai.

I can be reached at the following email address: thearchitc [at] gmail [dot]
com.  (The reason many people present their email addresses like this is that
if you write it normally, it is very easy for bots to register and spam the
address. The sad thing, however, is that my website get so little traffic
that I don't even have bots spamming my email...)
