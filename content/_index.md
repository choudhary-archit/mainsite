Hello! I am an eighteen year old Indian living in Belgium, just finished with
the [IB Diploma Programme](https://www.isbedu.be/). I am interested in most
things life has to offer, from
[STEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4y0-_jM7xE) and the
[humanities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7nNFeXLaCY) to [modal
jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uUCIQ50e-4) and
[calisthenics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU7Ue4xF3YI). I will be in the
2026 class of Engineering Technology at [KU
Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/).  I used to live in
Brussels, where I learnt to speak French. Mainly, however, I speak English and
Hindi --- I spent the first sixteen years of my life in Mumbai.

I can be reached at the following email address: thearchitc [at] gmail [dot]
com.  (The reason many people present their email addresses like this is that
if you write it normally, it is very easy for bots to register and spam the
address. The sad thing, however, is that my website gets so little traffic
that I don't even have bots spamming my email...)
