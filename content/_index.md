The first sentence of a person's webpage normally gives a one-line description
of who they are. I used to do this. The problem, however, is that in condensing
yourself to a mere, single sentence, in reducing your entire being down to an
astonishingly limited number of interests and, if you're lucky, qualities...
well, you lose quite a bit.

I take a profound interest in science and technology. I cherish equally the
pursuit of art in all its forms, and intellectual scholarship at its finest. I
indulge in sports and greatly esteem physical fitness. I am principled yet
empathetic, courageous yet noble, and bold in the face of responsibility.

But none of these interests or qualities define me when taken in isolation. I
am the ensemble of all of them, when combined with everything else that is to
me.

Philosophy aside, I should probably give some real info. I am 18 and I live in
Belgium. I am currently finishing the IB Diploma Programme at
[ISBe](https://www.isbedu.be/), and I will be in the 2026 class of Engineering
Technology at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/). I don't
have a drivers licence (yet). I used to live in Brussels, where I learnt to
speak French; mainly, however, I speak English and Hindi. And yes, I am of
Indian origin, having spent the first sixteen years of my life in Mumbai.
