I am an IB student living on the outskirts of Brussels, interested in
philosophy, art, and living. I plan to study mathematics at university after
graduating with my IB Diploma next year.

I have a long history with mathematics. I won the Indian National Mathematical
Olympiad in 2020 and was a merit awardee in 2021, though in my first attempt in
2019 I got a grand score of 2/102 in PRMO. Beside mathematics, I have been
studying many other subjects at my [school](https://www.isbedu.be), most of
whom I am very enthusiastic about; especially English. In general, I adore
reading, thinking, and writing, perhaps all three equally so. With music too I
have a certain history, though it is not interesting enough to talk about here.

I don't really exist on the Internet. If you wish to contact me online or just
check out what awesome stuff I have (not) been doing online, see my [contact
page]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}). The only way to really contact me from a
distance if you don't have my phone number is email. My résumé is available
[here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) for potential employers (or others of the same
species).  But the most exciting thing on this website is, of course, my
[blog]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}): scroll down to see the latest posts.
