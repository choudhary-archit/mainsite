I am an IB student living on the outskirts of Brussels interested in
mathematics, philosophy, computers, and getting ripped. I like using Oxford
commas. After graduating from IB next year, I am planning to study mathematics
at a cool place somewhere in Europe or the US.

I used to be involved in math olympiads back in India, and was an INMO Awardee
in 2020 (in Class 9). But that is mostly in the past: The National Board of
Higher Mathematics decided that I should not be allowed to take the INMO owing
to my being an IB student in Brussels. Nowadays, I focus on getting the most
out of IB because I cannot avoid it like I avoided CBSE and perhaps more
importantly because I do not want to; I am actually learning stuff.

I pursue my studies in English, with Hindi as my mother tongue and the language
I speak at home. But over the past year of living in Brussels, I have learnt
enough French to be at least at a B2 level. I have yet to be formally tested
though. This means that if I really wanted to, I could make this whole website
in French. I also speak Maithili somewhat passably, the language spoken in
the part of Bihar where my parents come from.

I exist on the Internet. If you wish to contact me online or just check out
what awesome stuff I have (not) been doing on the internet, see my
[contact page]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}). My résumé is available for potential
employers (or others of the same species) [here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}).
But the most exciting thing on this website is, of course, my [blog]({{< ref
"blog/_index.md" >}}). Scroll down to see the latest posts :)
