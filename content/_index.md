I am an IB student living on the outskirts of Brussels interested in
mathematics, philosophy, music, computers, and getting ripped. I like using
Oxford commas. After graduating from IB next year, I am planning to study
mathematics at a cool place somewhere in Europe or the US.

I used to be involved in math olympiads back in India, and was an INMO Awardee
in 2020 (in Class 9), but that is mostly in the past: The National Board of
Higher Mathematics decided that I shouldn't be allowed to take the INMO owing
to my being an IB student in Brussels. Nowadays, I focus on getting the most
out of IB because I can't avoid it like I avoided CBSE and perhaps more
importantly because I don't want to; I am actually learning stuff.

I pursue my studies in English, with Hindi as my mother tongue and the language
I speak at home. Over the past year of living in Brussels, however, I have
learnt enough French to be at least at a B2 level, though I have yet to be
formally tested. That is to say, if I really wanted to, I could make this whole
website in French. I also speak Maithili with a decent fluency, the language
spoken in the part of Bihar where my parents come from.

I exist on the Internet. If you wish to contact me online or just check out
what awesome stuff I have (not) been doing on the internet, see my
[contact page]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}). My résumé is available for potential
employers (or other members of the same species) [here]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}).
But the most exciting thing on this website is, of course, my [blog]({{< ref
"blog/_index.md" >}}). Scroll down to see the latest posts!
