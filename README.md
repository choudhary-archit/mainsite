This is the source code behind my personal website currently at the address
https://architchoudhary.xyz. As is visible, I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to
generate my website, and in particular the theme
[Notrack](https://github.com/gevhaz/hugo-theme-notrack) by [Simon
Bengtsson](https://github.com/gevhaz). I made a
[fork](https://github.com/choudhary-archit/hugo-theme-notrack) of this theme to
add MathJax support, though I don't really use it anymore.  Note that static
files, such as images, videos, etc., are omitted for obvious reasons.
